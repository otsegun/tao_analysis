**Pg 24** Prove that the sum of two natural numbers is again a natural number?


*Solution*: Let $n$ and $m$ be natural numbers. Using induction on $n$ and keeping $m$ fixed,we have the base case to be $0 + m := m$ which is a natural number as desired (by definition of addition and **Axiom 2.1**). 

Now we assume inductively $n+m$ is a natural number. We have to show that $(n++)+m$ is also a natural number. But $(n++) + m = (n+m)++$ by definition of addition and **Axiom 2.2**. However, $n+m$ is a natural number according to the inductive hypothesis and therefore $(n+m)++$ is also a natural number by **Axiom 2.2**.
$\square$

**Pg 26** Prove that $n++ = n+1$ 

*Solution 1*: Let $n$ be a natural number, then $n++ = (n++) + 0 = (n+0)++ = n + (0++) = n+1$ according to **Lemma 2.2.2**, definition of addition, **Lemma 2.2.3** and definition of increment respectively. $\square$

*Solution 2*: Using induction on $n$, we have to show that $0++ = 0+1$ for the base case. However, $0++ = 1 = 0 + 1$ by definitions of increment, and addition respectively and so the base case is done. 

Now suppose inductively that $n++ = n+1$, we have to show that $(n++) ++ = (n++) +1$.

From the RHS, $(n++)+1 = (n+1)++ = (n++)++$ by definition of addition and the inductive hypothesis repectively. $\square$

**Exercise 2.2.1.** (Addition is associative). Prove that for any natural numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, we have $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$.

*Solution*: Using induction on $a$ and keeping $a$ and $c$ fixed. For the base case, we want to show that $(0+b) + c = 0+(b+c)$. However, $(0+b) + c  = b+c = 0 + (b+c)$ by the definition of addition.

Now suppose inductively that $(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$, we have to show that $((a++)+b)+c = (a++) + (b+c)$.

From the RHS, we have that $(a++) + (b+c) = (a+(b+c))++ = ((a+b)+c)++$ by the definition of addition and the inductive hypothesis respectively. Furthermore, $((a+b)+c)++ = (((a+b)++)+c) = ((a++)+b)+c$ by definition of addition. $\square$

**Exercise 2.2.2.** Let $a$ be a positive number. Then there exists exactly one natural number $b$ such that $b++ = a$.

*Solution:* First we prove the existence of a natural number $b$ such that $b{++} = a$ for $a\in \mathbb{N}^+$ using induction on $a$. For the base case $a = 1$, we want to show that there exists a natural number $b$ such that $b{++} = 1$. Clearly, $0{++} = 1$ so $b = 0$.

Now suppose inductively that for any positive number $a$, there exists a natural number $b$ such that $b{++} = a$. 

We have to show that there exists a natural number $q$ such that $q++ = a++$. But $a++ = (b++)++$ by the inductive hypothesis, so that $q{++} = (b{++}){++}$ and by **Axiom 2.4**, $q = b{++}$. So that completes the induction and the proof existence.

Now we have to prove the uniqueness of the natural number $b$ such that $b{++} = a$ for $a\in \mathbb{N}^+$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exist $b$, $c$ $\in \mathbb{N}$ with $b\ne c$ such that $b{++} = a$ and $c{++} = a$. Then $b{++} = c{++}$ and by **Axiom 2.4** $b = c$ which is a contradiction. Consequently, there exists exactly one natural number $b$ such that $b{++} = a$  for $a\in \mathbb{N}^+$. $\square$

**Exercise 2.2.3.** Basic properties of order for natural numbers). Let a, b, c be natural numbers. Then
*Solution:*
\begin{enumerate}
\item (Order is reflexive) $a \ge a$.

$a = a + 0$ by \textbf{Lemma 2.2.3} , therefore, $a\ge a$ by definition. $\square$

\item (Order is transitive) If $a \ge b$ and $b \ge c$, then $a \ge c$.

By definition, $a\ge b$ implies that $a = b+d$ and $b \ge c$ implies $b = c + e$, for some $d$, $e$ $\in \mathbb{N}$. Therefore, $a = b + d = (c+e)+d = c +(e+d) \ge c$ by ordering of natural numbers and associativity of addition. $\square$.   

\item (Order is anti-symmetric) If $a \ge b$ and $b \ge a$, then $a = b$.


Since $a \ge b$ and $b \ge a$, we have that $a = b + c$ and $b = a + d$ for some $c$, $d$ $\in \mathbb{N}$. Thus $a = a + c + d$ which implies that $c+d = 0$ by \textbf{Lemma 2.2.2} and that further implies $c = 0$ and $d = 0$ by \textbf{Corollary 2.2.9}. Consequently, $a = b$. $\square$


\item (Addition preserves order) $a \ge b$ if and only if $a + c \ge b + c$.

Because $a\ge b$, $a = b+d$ for some $d \in \mathbb{N}$. Hence $a + c = (b+d) + c = (b+c) + d \ge b+c$ by the cancellation law, associativity of addition and ordering of natural numbers respectively.

Likewise, $a+c \ge b+c$ implies $a+c = (b+c) + e$, for some $e \in \mathbb{N}$. Consequently, $a+c = (b+e) + c$ by associativity of addition. By cancellation law, $a = b + e$ so $a\ge b$. $\square$ 

\item $a < b$ if and only if $a{++} \le b$

\textit{Proof.} Since $a<b$,  then $b = a+n$, for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $b \ne a$. Consequently, $n \ne 0$ by \textbf{Lemma 2.2.2}. Then there exists a number say $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m{++} = n$ by \textbf{Lemma 2.2.10}. So $b = a+n = a + m{++} = (a{++}) + m$ by \textbf{Lemma 2.2.3}. So $a{++} \le b$.

Likewise $a{++} \le b$ implies $b = (a{++}) + n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Consequently, $b = a + (n{++})$ by \textbf{Lemma 2.2.3} and by \textbf{Definition 2.2.1} (Addition of natural numbers). But we know that $n{++} \ne 0$ by \textbf{Axiom 2.3} and by implication $b \ne a$. So $a<b$. $\square$

\item $a < b$ if and only if $b = a + d$ for some positive number $d$.

\textit{Proof}. If $a<b$, then $b = a+d$ for some $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and $b\ne a$ by definition. We need to show that $d\ne 0$. Now suppose for the sake of contradiction that $d = 0$. Then $b = a+d$ implies $a = b$ which is a contradition so $d\ne0$. 

Likewise, $b = a+d$, $d \ne 0$ implies $a\le b$ by \textbf{Definition 2.2.11} (Ordering of the natural numbers). We need to show that $b \ne a$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $b = a$, then $b = a+d$ implies  $d = 0$ by \textbf{Lemma 2.2.2} which is a contradiction. Hence $b \ne a$ and $a\le b$ so $a<b$. $\square$

\end{enumerate}

**Exercise 2.2.4.** Justify the three statements marked (why?) in the proof of **Proposition 2.2.13**.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $0\le b$ for all $b\in \mathbb{N}$.

\textit{Proof}. Since $b \in \mathbb{N}$, then $b = 0 + b$ by \textbf{Definition 2.2.1} (Addition of natural numbers) so $0\le b$ by \textbf{Definition 2.2.11} (Ordering of the natural numbers). 

\item  If $a>b$, then $a{++} > b$

\textit{Proof}. Because $a{++}>a$ and $a>b$. Then by \textbf{Proposition 2.2.12} (Transitivity of order), $a{++} > b$. 

\item If $a = b$, the $a{++} =  b+d$

\textit{Proof}. Because $a{++}>a$ implies $a{++}>b$  since $a=b$. 

\end{enumerate}

**Exercise 2.2.5.** Prove **Proposition 2.2.14**. (Strong principle of induction). Let $m_0$ be a natural number, and let $P(m)$ be a property pertaining to an arbitrary natural number $m$. Suppose that for each $m \ge m_0$, we have the following implication: if $P(m')$ is true for all natural numbers $m_0 \le m' < m$ , then $P(m)$ is also true. (In particular, this means that $P(m_0)$ is true, since in this case the hypothesis is vacuous.) Then we can conclude that $P(m)$ is true for all natural numbers $m \ge m0$.

*Proof 1:* (Informal) Let $Q(n)$ be the property that $P(m)$ is true for all $m_o \le m < n$. Then if $n\le m_0$, then $Q(n)$ is vacuously true. If $n = m_0{++}$, then $Q(m_0{++})$ is true because $P(m)$ is true for all natural numbers $m_0 \le m < m_0{++}$ (since $P(m_0)$ is vacuously true) and by definition of $P$, $P(m_0{++})$ is also true. Likewise, if $n = (m_0{++})++$, then $Q((m_0{++})++)$ is true becuase  $P(m)$ is true for all $m_0 \le m < (m_0{++})++$ (since $P(m_0)$ and $P(m_0{++})$ are true) and by definition of $P$, $P((m_0{++})++)$ is also true. And so it goes on and on.    


*Proof:* Let $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and let $Q(n)$ be the property that $P(m)$ is true for all $m_0 \le m < n$ for $n\ge m_0$. Using induction on $n$, for the base case $n = 0$, we want to show that $Q(0)$ is true. However, we know that $0\le m_0\ \forall\ m_0 \in \mathbb{N}$. Thus, either $0 = m_0$ or $0<m_0$ and so we split into cases. If $n = 0 < m_0$, the statement $P(m)\ \forall\ m_0\le m < n$ is vacuously true (since the hypothesis applies for $n \ge m_0$) and thus $Q(0)$ is true in this case.  For the second case, if $n = 0 =m_0$, then the statement $P(m)\ \forall\ m_0\le m < n$ is also vacuously true since there is no $m' \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $0 \le m' <0$. Hence, $Q(0)$ is true for this case and that completes the base case of the induction. 

Now suppose inductively that for some $n\ge m_0$, $Q(n)$ is true, i.e $P(m)\ \forall\ m_0\le m < n$ is true. We need to show that $Q(n{++})$ is true. 

By the definition of $P$ in the hypothesis, $P(n)$ is also true (because $Q(n)$ is true). Since $n<n++$, then $P(m)\ \forall\ m_0\le m \le n < n++$ is true so $P(m)\ \forall\ m_0\le m < n++$ is true which in turn implies that $Q(n{++})$ is true. Which closes the induction and hence we can conclude that $Q(n)\ \forall n$ is true. 

However, $Q(n)$ true implies $P(m)\ \forall\ m_0\le m<n$ is true for all $n\ge m_0$ and by the definition of $P$, $P(n)$ is true  for all $n\ge m_0$ which concludes the proof. $\square$   



**Exercise 2.2.6.** Let $n$ be a natural number, and let $P(m)$ be a property pertaining to the natural numbers such that whenever $P(m{++})$ is true, then $P(m)$
is true. Suppose that $P(n)$ is also true. Prove that $P(m)$ is true for all natural
numbers $m \le n$; this is known as the principle of *backwards induction*. (Hint:
apply induction to the variable $n$.)


*Proof:* Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Using induction on $n$, for the base case $n = 0$, we need to show that $P(m)$ is true $\forall\ m\le 0$. But only $0\le 0$ so we just need to show that $P(0)$ is true. Since $P(n)$ is true from the hypothesis, $P(0)$ is true and that completes the base case. 

Suppose inductively that the principle if true for $n$, i.e $P$ is such that $P(n)$ is true, and whenever $P(m{++})$ is true, $P(m)$ is true $\forall m\le n$. We have to show the principle is true for $n{++}$ i.e we need to show that $P(m)$ is true $\forall\ m\le n++$ given that $P(n{++})$ is true and given that whenever $P(m{++})$ is true, $P(m)$ is true.

Since $P(n{++})$ is true, then $P(n)$ is also true. So we have to show that $P(m)$ is true $m<n$. But from the inductive hypothesis, $P(m)$ is true $\forall$ $m\le n$ and that completes the inductive hypothesis. $\square$


**Exercise 2.3.1.** Prove Lemma 2.3.2. (Multiplication is commutative). Let $n$, $m$ be natural numbers. Then $n \times m$ = $m \times n$. 

*Proof:* First we'll present some lemmas

*Lemma1:* $m\times 0 = 0$ for any natural number $m$.

*Proof:* Using induction on $m$, we have the base case to be $0\times 0 = 0$ by definition of multiplication. Suppose inductively that $m \times 0 = 0$ is true for $m\in \mathbb{N}$, we want to show that it is also true that $m{++}\times 0 = 0$. But, $m{++}\times 0 = (m \times 0) + 0 = 0+0 = 0$. 

*Lemma2:* $n \times m{++} = (n \times m)+n$ for natural numbers $n$ and $m$.

*Proof:* Inducting on $n$ and fixing $m$, we have the base case to be $0 \times m{++} = 0 = 0+0 = (0\times m) + 0$ as desired. Now suppose inductively that $n \times m{++} = (n \times m)+n$ is true, we have to show that $n{++} \times m{++} = (n{++} \times m)+n{++}$. From the LHS we have, 

\begin{align*}
n{++} \times m{++} &= (n \times m{++})+m{++} && \text{by definition of multiplication} \\
&= ((n \times m)+n)+m{++} && \text{by the inductive hypothesis} \\
&= (((n \times m)+n){++}) + m && \textbf{Lemma 2.2.3} \\
&= (n \times m)+ n{++} + m && \textbf{Lemma 2.2.3} \\
&= (n \times m) + m + n{++} && \text{by associative law} \\
&= (n{++} \times m) + n{++} && \text{by definition of multiplication}
\end{align*}

as desired.

Now we'll show that for $n$, $m$ natural numbers, $n \times m = m \times n$.  Inducting on $n$ and keeping $m$ fixed, the base case is to show that $0 \times m= m \times 0$. However,  $0 \times m = 0$ by definition and $m \times 0 = 0$ from *Lemma1* above which completes the base case as desired. Now suppose inductively that $n\times m = m\times n$, we have to show that $n{++}\times m = m\times n{++}$. But $n{++}\times m =  (n\times m)+ m = (m\times n)+ m$ by defintion of multiplication and the inductive hypothesis. However, $(m\times n)+ m = m\times n{++}$ according to *Lemma2* above. $\square$    

**Exercise 2.3.2.** Prove Lemma 2.3.3. (Positive natural numbers have no zero divisors). Let $n$, $m$ be natural numbers. Then $n \times m = 0$ if and only if at least one of $n$, $m$ is equal to zero. In particular, if $n$ and $m$ are both positive, then $nm$ is also positive.


*Proof:*
We'll prove the second statement first as a lemma.

*Lemma1:* If $n$ and $m$ are both positive, then $nm$ is also positive. 

*Proof:* Let $n,\ m$ be positive numbers. Using strong induction on $n$ while keeping $m$ fixed. For the base case $n = 1>0$, we want to show that $1\times m$ is positive. But $1\times m = 0{++}\times m = (0\times m) +m = m$ which is postive. Suppose that $nm$ is positive for all $x$ such that $1\le x < n{++}$, we want to show it is true for $n{++}$. But we know that $n{++}\times m = (n\times m) + m$ which is positive since $n\times m$ is positive (from the inductive hypothesis) and since addition of two positive numbers is also a positive number. Hence, $nm$ is positive for all $n,\ m \ge 1$   


Now we'll show that for $n$, $m$ natural numbers, $n \times m = 0$ if and only if at least one of $n$, $m$ is equal to zero. First we'll show that $n\times m = 0$ implies that at least one of $n,\ m$ is zero. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exists $n,\ m \ne0$ such that $n\times m = 0$, then according to *Lemma1*, there is a contradiction so at least one of $n, \ m$ is zero. 

Next we'll show that if at least one of $n,\ m$ is zero, then $n\times m= 0$. Either one of $n,\ m$ is zero or both of $n,\ m$ are zero so we split into cases. If both $n,\ m$ are zero, then $n\times m = 0\times 0= 0$ as desired. If one of $n,\ m$ is zero, either $n = 0$ and $m \ne 0$ or $n\ne 0$ and $m = 0$ so we split into cases. If $n = 0$ and $m \ne 0$, then $n\times m = 0\times m = 0$ by definiton. Likewise, if  $n\ne 0$ and $m = 0$, then $n\times m = n \times 0 =0$ by *Lemma1* of **Exercise 2.3.1.**. $\square$   



**Exercise 2.3.3.** Prove Proposition 2.3.5. (Multiplication is associative). For any natural numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, we have $(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$.

*Proof*: Let$a$, $b$, $c$ be natural numbers. Inducting on $c$ while keeping others fixed. We have to show for the base case that $(a\times b)\times 0 = a\times (b\times0)$. Both the RHS and LHS equal to zero as desired. Supose inductively that $(a\times b)\times c = a\times (b\times c)$, we have to show that $(a\times b)\times c{++} = a\times (b\times c{++})$. But 
\begin{align*}
(a\times b)\times c{++} &= \left[(a\times b)\times c\right] + (a\times b) && \text{by definition of $\times$} \\
&= \left[a\times (b\times c)\right] + (a\times b) && \text{by the inductive hypothesis} \\
&= a(bc) + ab  &&  \\
&= a[bc+b]  && \text{by distributive law} \\
&= a\times(b\times c{++})&& \text{by definition} 
\end{align*}

as desired and so we close the induction. $\square$   
**Exercise 2.3.4.** Prove the identity $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ for all natural numbers $a$, $b$.

*Proof:* We have that 

\begin{align*}
(a+b)^2 &= (a+b)(a+b) && \text{by definition of exponentiation} \\
&= a(a+b) + b(a+b) && \text{by the distributive law} \\
&= aa + ab + ba + bb && \text{by the distributive law} \\
&= a^2 + ab + ab + b^2 && \text{by definition of exponentiation, and commutativity of $\times$} \\
&= a^2 + a(b + b) + b^2 && \text{by distributive law} \\
&= a^2 + a((1\times b) + b) + b^2 && \text{by definition of multiplication} \\
&= a^2 + a(1{++}\times b) + b^2 && \text{by definition of multiplication} \\
&= a^2 + a(2b) + b^2 && \text{by definition of increment} \\
&= a^2 + 2ab + b^2 && \hfill \square
\end{align*}

**Exercise 2.3.5.** Prove Proposition 2.3.9. (Euclidean algorithm). Let $n$ be a natural number, and let $q$ be a positive number. Then there exist natural numbers $m$, $r$ such that $0 \le r < q$ and $n = mq + r$. (*Hint*: fix $q$ and induct on $n$.)

*Proof:* Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Inducting on $n$ and fixing $q$, for the base case $n = 0$, we need to show that for some $q\in\mathbb{N+}$ there exist $m$, $r$ $\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $0 = mq+r$. But $0 = 0+0$ and we also know that $0\times q = 0\  \forall q\ \in\ \mathbb{N+}$ so $0 = 0\times q + 0$. Taking $m = 0$ and $r = 0$ completes the proof of the base case. 


Suppose inductively that the algorithm is true for $n$, i.e for some $q \in \mathbb{N+}$ there exist  $m$, $r$ $\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n = mq+r$ with $0 \le r < q$. We have to show the principle is true for $n{++}$ i.e we need to show that for some $k \in \mathbb{N+}$, there exist $a$, $b$ $\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n{++} = ak+b$ with $0\le b < k$. But $n{++} = n + 1 = (mq + r) + 1 = mq + r+1 = mq + r{++}$. Since $r<q$, then  $r++ \le q$ which means that either $r{++}<q$ or $r{++} = q$. If $r{++} < q$, then taking $a = m$, $b = r{++}$ and $k = q$ completes the case as desired. On the otherhand, if $r{++} = q$, then 
$$n{++} = mq + q = (m{++})q = (m{++})q + 0.$$

Taking $a = m{++}$, $b = 0$, $q = k$ completes the proof. $\square$

# Chapter 3
**Exercise 3.1.1.** Show that the definition of equality in Definition 3.1.4 is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

**Reflexive:** We need to show that for an arbitrary set $A$, $A = A$.

*Proof:* Let $A$ be an arbitrary set and let $x$ be an arbitrary object in $A$, i.e $x\in A$. Then it is trivially true that $A = A$ because any arbitrary $x$ in $A$ is an element of $A$ so by **Definition 3.1.4**(Equality of Sets), $A = A$ and consequently equality of sets is reflexive. 

**Symmetric:** Given two sets $A$ and $B$. If $A = B$, $B = A$.

*Proof:* Let $A$ and $B$ be arbitrary sets such that $A = B$. Then all the elements of $A$ are in $B$ and all the elements of $B$ are in $B$. So $B = A$ for the same reasons by **Definition 3.1.4**(Equality of Sets). Thus, equality of sets is symmetric.

**Transitive:** Given 3 sets $A$, $B$ and $C$. If $A = B$ and $B = C$, then $A = C$.

*Proof:* Let $A$, $B$  and $C$ be arbitrary sets such that $A = B$ and $B = C$. Let $x$ be an arbitrary object in $A$, then $x\in B$ and since $B=C$, $x\in C$. Likewise, let $y\in C$, then  $y\in B$ and since $A = B$, $y\in A$. So all the elements of A are in $C$ and vice versa so $A = C$. Thus, equality of sets is transitive.

**Exercise 3.1.2.** Using only Definition 3.1.4, Axiom 3.1, Axiom 3.2, and Axiom 3.3, prove that the sets  $\{\emptyset\}$, $\{\{\emptyset\}\}$ and $\{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\} \}$ are all distinct (i.e., no two of them are equal to each other). 

*Proof:* Considering $\emptyset$ and $\{\emptyset\}$. By Axiom 3.2, $x\notin \emptyset$ for all $x$. However, $\emptyset \in \{\emptyset\}$ and since $\emptyset \notin \emptyset$, $\emptyset \neq \{\emptyset\}$. Furthermore, $\emptyset \neq \{\{\emptyset\}\}$ becuase $\{\emptyset\} \in \{\{\emptyset\}\}$ but $\{\emptyset\}\notin \emptyset$. Likewise, $\{\emptyset\} \neq \{\{\emptyset\}\}$ because $\{\emptyset\} \in \{\{\emptyset\}\}$ but $\{\emptyset\} \notin \{\emptyset\}$. Also $\{\{\emptyset\}\} \neq \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}$ because $\emptyset\notin \{\{\emptyset\}\}$ but $\emptyset\in \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}$

**Exercise 3.1.3** Prove the remaining claims in Lemma 3.1.13. 

*Claim:* If $a$ and $b$ are objects, then $\{a, b\}$ = $\{a\} \cup \{b\}$.

*Proof*: Let $x\in\{a,b\}$, then by Axiom 3.3, $x = a$ or $x = b$. If $x = a$, then $x\in \{a\} \cup \{b\}$ (since $x\in\{a\}$). Likewise, if $x = b$, then  $x\in \{a\} \cup \{b\}$. So therefore, $x\in\{a,b\}$ implies $x\in \{a\} \cup \{b\}$. 

On the contrary, let $y\in \{a\} \cup \{b\}$, then by Axiom 3.4, $y\in\{a\}$ or $y\in\{b\}$ so we split into cases. If $y\in\{a\}$, then by Axiom 3.3, $y = a$ and since $y = a\in\{a,b\}$, $y\in\{a,b\}$. Also, if $y\in\{b\}$, then $y\in\{a,b\}$ following the same line of argument. So in both cases, if $y\in \{a\} \cup \{b\}$, then $y\in\{a,b\}$.

Consequently, $\{a, b\}$ = $\{a\} \cup \{b\}$. 

*Claim:* $A\cup B = B\cup A$.

*Proof: * Let $x$ be an object such that $x\in a\cup B$. Then by Axiom 3.4, $x\in A$ or $x\in B$. If $x\in A$, then $x\in B\cup A$ ($B\cup A \iff x\in B \text{ or } x\in A$) and if  If $x\in B$, then $x\in B\cup A$. Consequently, if $x\in A\cup B$, then $x\in B\cup A$. Following the ssame argument, if $y\in B\cup A$, then $y\in A\cup B$.

Since all the objects of $A\cup B$ is also in $B\cup A$ and vice versa, then $A\cup B = B\cup A$.

**Exercise 3.1.4** Prove the remaining claims in Proposition 3.1.18.

*Claim:* Let A, B be sets. If $A\subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$, then $A = B$.

*Proof:* Let A and B be sets such that $A\subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$. Since $A\subseteq B$, if $x\in A$ then $x\in B$ by Definition Definition 3.1.15 (Subsets). Likewise, if $y\in B$, then $y\in A$ (because $B \subseteq A$). Since all the element of $A$ are in $B$ and all the elements of $B$ are in $A$, then $A = B$.


*Claim:* If $A \subsetneq  B$ and $B \subsetneq C$ then $A \subsetneq C$. 

*Proof:* Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be sets such that $A \subsetneq  B$ and $B \subsetneq C$. By definition 3.1.15, we have to show that $A \subseteq C$ and $A\neq C$. Let $x$ be any arbitrary object in $A$. Then $x\in B$ and $x\in C$ (since $A \subsetneq  B$ and $B \subsetneq C$). Consequently, $A \subseteq C$. Now we have to show that $A \neq C$. Since $A\subsetneq B$ ($A \subseteq B$ and $A \ne B$), there exist at lease one object $y\in B$ such that, $y\notin A$. However, $y\in B$ implies $y\in C$ (since $B\subsetneq C$). Since $y\in C$ and $y\notin A$, $A \ne C$ and that completes the proof. 


**Exercise 3.1.5** Let A, B be sets. Show that the three statements $A \subseteq B$, $A \cup B = B$, $A \cap B = A$ are logically equivalent (any one of them implies the other two).

*Claim 1:* If $A\subseteq B$, then $A\cup B = B$. 

*Proof:* Let A and B be arbitrary sets such that $A\subseteq B$ and let $x\in A\cup B$, then either $x\in A$ or $x\in B$ so we split into cases. If $x\in B$, then we're done as required. On the contrary. if $x\in A$, then $x\in B$ also (since $A \subseteq B$). So in both cases, if $x\in A\cup B$, then $x\in B$.

Now let $y\in B$, then by Axiom 3.4 (Pairwise union), $y\in A\cup B$. Since all the elements of $A\cup B$ are in $B$ and vice versa whenever $A\subseteq B$, then $A\cup B = B$ whenever $A\subseteq B$.

*Claim 2:* If $A\subseteq B$, then $A\cap B = A$. 

*Proof:* Let A and B be arbitrary sets such that $A\subseteq B$ and let $x\in A\cap B$, then by Definition 3.1.23 (Intersections) $x\in A$. Now let $y\in A$, then  $y\in B$ also (since $A\subseteq B$) so $y\in A\cap B$. Since all the elements of $A\cap B$ are in $A$ and vice versa whenever $A\subseteq B$, then $A\cap B = A$ whenever $A\subseteq B$.

*Claim 3:* If $A\cup B = B$, then $A\subseteq B$

*Claim 4:* If $A\cup B = B$, then $A\cap B = A$

*Claim 5:* If $A\cap B = A$, then $A\subseteq B$

*Claim 6:* If $A\cap B = A$, then $A\cup B = B$

**Exercise 3.1.6** Prove Proposition 3.1.28. (Sets form a boolean algebra). Let $A$, $B$, $C$ be sets,
and let $X$ be a set containing $A$, $B$, $C$ as subsets.

*Claim (a):* (Minimal element) We have $A \cup \emptyset = A$ and $A \cap \emptyset = \emptyset$.

*Proof:* For $A \cup \emptyset = A$, we have to show that any object $x\in A$ is also in $A \cup \emptyset$ and vice versa. Let $x$ be any arbitrary object in $A$. Then by Axiom 3.4 (Pairwise Union), $x\in A\cup \emptyset$. Likewise if $x\in A\cup \emptyset$, thhen $x\in A$ or $x\in \emptyset$. However, for all $x$, $x\notin \emptyset$ so therefore, $x\in A$. Since $x\in A$ implies $x\in A\cup \emptyset$ and vice versa, $A\cup \emptyset = A$ 

For $A \cap \emptyset = \emptyset$. Let $x\in A \cap \emptyset$, then by Definition 3.1.23, $x\in A$ and $x\in \emptyset$. However, $x\notin\emptyset$ for all $x$ so the statements $x\in A \cap \emptyset \implies x\in\emptyset$ is vacuously true. Likewise, the statement $x\in \emptyset \implies x\in A\cap \emptyset$ is vacuously true. So $A\cap\emptyset = \emptyset$.

*Claim (b):* (Maximal element) We have $A \cup X = X$and $A \cap X = A$.

*Proof:* Let $m\in A\cup X$. Then either $m\in A$ or $m\in X$. If $m\in A$, then $m\in X$ since $A\subseteq X$.\ so in both cases, $m\in X$. Likewise, let $n\in X$, then $n\in A\cup X$. So $A \cup X = X$.

For $A \cap X = A$, let $y\in A\cap X$. Then $y\in A$. Likewise, if $y\in A$, then $y\in X$ since $A\subseteq X$ so $y\in A\cap X$. Therefore, $A \cap X = A$.

*Claim (c):* (Identity) We have $A \cap A = A$ and $A \cup A = A$.

*Proof:* Let $x\in A\cap A$, then $x\in A$. Likewise, if $x\in A$, then $x\in A\cap A$ so $A\cap A = A$. 

For $A \cup A = A$, let $y\in A\cup A$, then $y\in A$ and if $y\in A$, then $y\in A\cup A$ so $A \cup A = A$.

*Proof2: * Since $A\subseteq A$, using principle of maximal element (i.e, taking $X$ to be $A$), then $A\cap X = A$ implies $A\cap A = A$ and $A\cup X = X$ implies $A\cup A = A$.

*Claim (d):* (Commutativity) We have $A \cup B = B \cup A$ and $A \cap B = B \cap A$

*Proof:* For $A \cup B = B \cup A$, see Exercise 3.1.3. 

*Claim (e):* (Associativity) We have $(A\cup B)\cup C = A\cup(B\cup C)$ and $(A\cap B)\cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$.
